# enhanced-resolve

Offers an async require.resolve function. It's highly configurable.

## Features

- plugin system
- provide a custom filesystem
- sync and async node.js filesystems included

## Getting Started

### Install

```sh
# npm
npm install enhanced-resolve
# or Yarn
yarn add enhanced-resolve
```

### Resolve

There is a Node.js API which allows to resolve requests according to the Node.js resolving rules.
Sync and async APIs are offered. A `create` method allows to create a custom resolve function.

```js
const resolve = require("enhanced-resolve");

resolve("/some/path/to/folder", "module/dir", (err, result) => {
	result; // === "/some/path/node_modules/module/dir/index.js"
});

resolve.sync("/some/path/to/folder", "../../dir");
// === "/some/path/dir/index.js"

const myResolve = resolve.create({
	// or resolve.create.sync
	extensions: [".ts", ".js"]
	// see more options below
});

myResolve("/some/path/to/folder", "ts-module", (err, result) => {
	result; // === "/some/node_modules/ts-module/index.ts"
});
```

### Creating a Resolver

The easiest way to create a resolver is to use the `createResolver` function on `ResolveFactory`, along with one of the supplied File System implementations.

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const { CachedInputFileSystem, ResolverFactory } = require("enhanced-resolve");

// create a resolver
const myResolver = ResolverFactory.createResolver({
	// Typical usage will consume the `fs` + `CachedInputFileSystem`, which wraps Node.js `fs` to add caching.
	fileSystem: new CachedInputFileSystem(fs, 4000),
	extensions: [".js", ".json"]
	/* any other resolver options here. Options/defaults can be seen below */
});

// resolve a file with the new resolver
const context = {};
const resolveContext = {};
const lookupStartPath = "/Users/webpack/some/root/dir"
